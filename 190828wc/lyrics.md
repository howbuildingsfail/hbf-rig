# Ex Vocation

This is my ex vocation
no need to explain
or to try to justify 
this decision

I am no longer commited
to do any of this
don't call it
artistic freedom

embrace the inactivity
unfinished projects
all behind me

play ps4 if i like
no one will remember me

20 summers left
no need
to make a difference
dont feel like i
need to be a difference
i did not start this
to feel a difference

non existent gaps
in non existent markets
I'm not here to create 
or to find those things

this is my ex vocation
live performeromerance
as punctuation 
of failed audiobedsit experiments

this is my ex vocation
turn up at 10
leave at 4 fuck it 
no need to explain

post-infotech revolutuionists
I sneer and I snipe
and I don't bother coalescing my bile
I *refuse* to condense it
into any sort of message

make a mess with the delay pedal
fuck up the drum machine
the guitar hurts my fingers
20 summers left

because this





# Total Control Too Long 

I'm beginning to wonder 
if i've had 
total control too long (= IBTWIIHTCTL)

whether to hand back power
to the idiots i took it from

i set up on my own
half a lifetime ago
i couldn't find a kindred spirit
couldn't connect another soul

IBTWIIHTCTL

I  set the duration 
of this audio I give to you
I set out the delivery
I choose the beat and the tune

but

IBTWIIHTCTL

whether to hand back power
to the idiots i took it from

their clockwork genius bores me
effortlessness increases the effort
i doubt myself and crave attention
if i know i can do it
i don't need to bother

IBTWIIHTCTL

half assed brass trombones
have more power than trevor horn the clown
if its a sufficient condition
for ending this practice

I decide where the rain falls
i decide the phase of the moon

I have got to the place 
I wanted to get to 
I can see it all 
from here





# Shared External Memory

Friends 
are my

Shared External Memory (=SEM)

Access the past
I need you - you are my

SEM

meet up in smokeless pine clad rooms
you can smeel the beer now the fags have gone

SEM

This law applies retrospectively 
EM
fuckit pub

remake the shape. The shape I created
reinforce the pattern

SEM

no contradictions here
SEM
it's a common previous existence

# It's not you, Culture


Its not you culture its me 

I am in the habit of concealing myself
I am in the habit of contradicting myself
by the upstairs back door

Something happened to me as a young man
something probably happened to me as a young man

there is no nash equilibrim in this situation
there is only so much attention that I can give
I can not dance to your dance music 
and I hate what you did to the human league and heaven 17

I do not get the happy happy songs
the milkman whistles teenage kicks

I see beauty in ditches and pylons; the manhole cover forms a face
I burn the toast and I eat it anyway
