# Making Cleanfeed work:

- make sure sound is "on" before running script
- killall chrome
- switch to ../trset1/run/start.sh and run it
- start qtractor
- start sc
- start atom/tidal
- start pd? 


## 201130 test

- killall chrome
- ...run/start.sh
- start qtractor.
- NO LUCK!
- hit 'stop' on qjackctl (kills qtractor and bme)
- start BME
- connect BME to 


# Strategy

- Start in pulseaudio
- ChapelFM will invite me to join their broadcast
- we chat then I'm off. 
- I launch qjackctl, supercollider, atom and qtractor etc - this could be script 1. Launch BME with an LFO going on mem1.
- I have to hit a note at this point to start the session
- then I can manually start sc and tidal, and run script 2 to connect everything again. 
- Then the performance can slowly build.
