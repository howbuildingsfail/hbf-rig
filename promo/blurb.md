How Buildings Fail is the mostly solo, mostly electronic musical project of mostly Simon Hickinbotham. The project began in 2015 in parallel with a guitar based sister project that had been running since the early 1990s. Playing mostly in York, but occasionally in Leeds and Leicester, the emphasis is upon improvisation using self-made electronic instruments. Convetional gigs include songs about art predating on golden age comics, falling out with "culture" and finding money in car parks. Unconventional gigs involve live coding, prototype drum machines, and circuit bent effects pedals.
