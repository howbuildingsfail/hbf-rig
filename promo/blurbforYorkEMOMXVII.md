# How Buildings Fail

is the mostly solo, mostly electronic project of Simon Hickinbotham, who runs the York EMOM nights. HBF has been gigging since 2016, and performances at EMOM are usually attempts to try out new things, ranging from live coding, through self-built synths, modular bits and bobs, or circuit bent drum machines with varying degrees of success. This recording caputures experiments with two instruments. Firstly self-built drum machine based on the arduino O2 minipops code originally developed by Jan Ostman, but with controls for pitch, sample cutoff and bitcrushing of some of the voices. This was coupled via clock out to a Wonkystuff Core 1, which had been flashed with a bytebeat variant. Both these instuments were fed through a Fuzzdog Deep Blue Delay via the mixer.
