# Fulford 180419

This was at short notice - no time to alter the set from the previous gig at the Woolpack - even if I wanted to!
Had to rebuild the OscFac and the PotNoodle as they'd been dismantled...


## Set

- *Actually Reading Comics*
- *Red Mecca Bingo*
- *Martyn Lives*
- *Click Bait*
- *To Get Music*
- *We Are So Facile*
- *Creative Supply*

## Post Mortem

OscFac seemed to fail sometime during ToGetMusic - didn't recover it, but
didn't try that hard - worried about overdoing it... Somehow I hit the 
mute button on the laptop 




# Woolpack 180210

## Set

- *Actually Reading Comics*
- *Red Mecca Bingo*
- *Martyn Lives*
- *Click Bait*
- *To Get Music*
- *We Are So Facile*
- *Creative Supply*

## Post Mortem

Had initial trouble setting up because I'd plugged the midi cable 
into the wrong socket on the drum machine. *Tiny* table to set up on,
but fitted it in nicely - used as the basis for a 'pedalboard'

## Planned Set 

- 3:00 *Into the Silence* **a,b** code volca; practice fzbx touchosc
- 3:00 *Actually Reading Comics* **c,d** code initial volca - use for a reset val too;  touchosc
- 3:00 *Red Mecca Bingo* **a,b** code bme sweeps / prctice volca
- 2:00 *Martyn Lives* 
- 4:00 *End of the Terrace* **d**
- 7:00 *Click Bait* 
- 3:00 *Creative Supply* 
- 2:00 *Walk Around* **a**
- 3:00 *To Get Music*
- 2:00 *We Are So Facile* **e**
- 3:00 *Climate Denial* **d,e**


...adds up to 35 mins - need to trim

## Issues

- a: More programming needed
- b: Finalise lyrics
- c: Finalise structure
- d: fzbx coding needed
- e: guitar part 

## TODO

### Crumar

- set up memory properly


### fzbx

- Practice with fzbx - sliders for fuzz and comp only - leave stab and gate to manual - allows fine tuning
- fuzzbox switching for guitar.
- Try fzbx with dist and comp only on arduino - see if that'll work...
- memorize good guitar setting for 


### Rehearsal, 180129

I tried to do the whole set, but there were problems with the fuzzbox and touchosc, and I don't have a playlist yet, so I did what I could. Unfortunately the vocals are a little quiet on the recording. Whilst I was performing, I felt as if there was something missing, but listening back, it's not bad! 
I felt I had just about enough to do whilst performing - much more and it'd fall to bits. It'd be nice to get the slideshow sorted tho.
In the list below, songs in brackets werent' done!

- *(Into The Silence)* - need to get the midi file sorted for this.
- *Actually Reading Comics* - haven't quite got the structure there yet. Maybe some sonic cues to know when to sing?
- *Red Mecca Bingo* - First time I've sung through. Need to learn the words, but it's going well. No Fzbx in this atm! Glitchy drums seemed to work...
- *(Climate Denial)* - didn't have the guitar set up 
- *Martyn Lives* - there's a good bit where I 'beat' the fzbx in time with the drums...
- *End of the Terrace* - It's quite good fun doing this without the sequencer - but it would be good to set the volca up with a quick MIDI parameter sweep before hand. Not hard to do. Of course it works better when touchosc is playing ball!
- *Click Bait* - **really** fuxed up drums - but it seemed to work. Touchosc couldn't play the roadrunner - need to set that up better also - possibly have a range of different memory options
- *Creative Supply* - The drums need fixing! - word timing needs working on
- *Walk Around* - Drums need fixing again - liked the mucking about with the volca though. Possibly introduce a dropout on the bar starting `debt fuelled worry`
- *We Are So Facile* - ran out of time - would have needed to code it up...
- *To Get Music* - no time. 


Need to make sure the following are fixed:

- fzbx - it isn't behaving - I've unplugged one of the three leads from the gain switch to the breadboard - hoping that's it! Possibly remove the #define for MIDI out also - it doesn't update touchosc anyway...
- touchosc - wouldn't connect to fzbx, but it was linking up with the BME and volca... need to check what version is the latest on the fzbx...
- vocals - set the mixer up better
- playlist - let's get on this first - it makes things so much easier
- UBUNTU - which one am I going to use? 16.04 with unity looks good atm. 

### Rehearsal 180204

- *Actually Reading Comics* 0:00 - 3.49 - went well! might need to extend final verse
- *Red Mecca Bingo* 4:00-5:15  Drums didn't sound that good! 5:38-8:40  The words work ok - but I need to learn them and 
- *Climate Denial* 8:41- There's a weird bit here - struggled to get the fuzzbox working properly for some reason - possibly incompetence, but possibly instability (actually it's because the arduino on the midi is set to omni atm) 9:42-14:15
- *Martyn Lives* 16:40-20:15 (probably no need for the fuzzbox on this... turn it down at least!)
- *Click Bait* 21:40-30:12 Somehow struggled to get the volca and roadrunner working proply for a bit - not sure all the presets for the volca are working either. Some great fuzzbox at the end!
- *Creative Supply* 30:20-33:30 - need to get the drums sorted for this
- *Walk Around* 33:40 - drums not quite there....
- *We Are So Facile* - We have to finish this! Possibly change the bassline a bit so its less of a copy. Incorporate the guitar bit 
- *To Get Music* good but a bit much fzbx

**Decision:** - Don't do *Climate Denial* or *Walk Around* 
**Decision:** - NO GUITAR!
