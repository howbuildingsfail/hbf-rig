potential lyrics from model engineer!:

Hi Alan,
Two strokes  are notorious for fowling their spark plugs. Take the plug out and while earthing it, trigger the points and see what sort of a spark you get. If it is a bright orange one, or not firing across the the electrodes, your plug is fowled. Give it a good clean and don't think that because you cleaned it two minutes ago that it hasn't fowled again. They can fowl in seconds, especially if it is running rich or over oiled.
The ideal colour of spark is bluey-white, I believe that the orange colour is from ionizing the excess oil or petrol vapours. Just because you have a spark, it does not mean it will fire the mixture, it has to be the right sort of spark.
Years of motorcycle two strokes have taught me this. I wont bore you lot with tales of Yamahas so flooded that the exhausts were half full of liquid petrol. It does bring to mind though the thought that if your engine wont start, have you tried turning the engine upside down, and without the spark plug in, turned the prop. If liquid comes out the plug hole it is a sure sign that the crankcase was flooded.
