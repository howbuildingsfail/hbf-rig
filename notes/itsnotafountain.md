# It's not a fountain

Duchamp's fountain wasn't his - see Punt PI show on Radio 4. But a point was missed- I think he was applying his *objet trouvee* idea, but here the found object *was someone else's art!*



Timeline:

- Duchamp establishes his 'readymades'
- Finds himself on the panel of the exhibition in NYC
- Sees R.Mutt's submission - it is of course the perfect readymade - a much *better* readymade than the ones hes done so far. And *even though it was created by another artist* the readymade concept means he can declare it as his - it is the ultimate readymade because of this, because the readymade concept means that credit is transferred to the beholder from the creator. 
- He knows how controversial this could be and resigns from the committee in order to claim it as his own. Bribing Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven to keep schtumm about it, or possibly persueading her of the potential of the delicious secret.
