I'm so happy to be here tonight 
so glad to be in your wonderful city 
14 
I have a message
for every woman and man tonight
18
that ever needed somebody to love

someone to stay with them all the time

when they're up
and when they are down

sometimes you get what you want
then you lose what you had
30
but I believe if every woman and man tonight listen
it might help you

38
everybody wants somebody
everybody needs somebody
to love
someone to love 
50
someone to kiss 
sometimes miss
someone to squeeze 
someone to please
and i need you you you
i need you you you 
i need you you you
i need you you you

Lyrics
I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home
And I believe I've got a message for every woman and every man 
Here tonight that ever needed somebody to love
