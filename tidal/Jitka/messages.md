The audio for the piece was performed by Simon Hickinbotham, using a new techniqe for music production called *live coding*. Using this approach, patterns of audio synthesis are written in small chunks of ascii computer code, using a Haskell-based domain specific language called TidalCycles \cite{}. The technique echoes many of the features of Artificial Life: the specification is dynamic, changing through time; the relative frequency of random elements in the performance can be controlled; emergent structures can be rejected or assimilated into the piece; there is a loose coupling between the sub-components, mediated by the composer.

Cool!
Thank you!
I like both!
So may I use this music?
It is yours, right?
Could you write me more about you / the song?
I would like to include it into the proposal...
So all songs from this profile are yours? https://soundcloud.com/howbuildingsfail

Hi yes, that's right - personally I think the two tracks I sent you are the most appropriate for your videos. I'm happy for you to use them if you want, but I'll still try to do something new for the film just to see if I can do better!
I'll try to write something for the proposal later today

I am listening also other songs... All are cool and suitable for my movie. Now I am listening "The World Is A Bubble" - just an idea: to prepare something in similar way and to say some parts from RUR (the play where the word robot was used first time)

And then, Miss Glory, this is what he wrote down in his chemical notes: â€žNature has found only one way of organising living matter. There is however another way which is simpler, easier to mould, and quicker to produce than Nature ever stumbled across. This other path along which life might have developed is what I have just discovered.â€œ Just think: he wrote these words about a blob of some kind of coloidal jelly that not even a dog would eat. Imagine him sitting with a test tube and thinking about how it could grow out into an entire tree of life made of all the animals starting with a tiny coil of life and ending with . . . ending with man himself. Man made of different material than we are. Miss Glory, this was one of the great moments of history.

"creative supply" is also great!

...It was in 1920 when old Rossum, still a young man then but a great scientist, came to live on this isolated island in order to study marine biology. Stop. Alongside his studies, he made several attempts to synthesise the chemical structure of living tissues, known as protoplasm, and he eventually discovered a material that behaved just the same as living tissue despite being, chemically, quite different....

Great idea! What sort of time frame are we talking about?

My idea was to create a movie cca 5 min long... But there are no limits, it can be shorter/longer... First I am looking for a music and then I will trim the videos.

Anyway I have forgotten my external disc with experimental data in the lab, so I can start to work on it on Monday.. So if you have an idea to compose a new song, let me know how much time do you need. I think I need it at latest on Tuesday or Wednesday (deadline is July 1)
I am so excited that I can collaborate with a scientist (alifer!) in such a way ðŸ™‚ Thank you! I hope we will prepare cool film an not only ALIFE 2018 participants will like it ðŸ™‚
