## Oscifuzz

- Worked satisfactorally at the last wonkystuff gig, but still has noise and reliability issues.
- Needs major overhaul as the wiring is getting pretty crazy
- Need to evaluate single power supply - 9v or via USB?
- Plan: Rebox, possibly in PS4 case
- Need to understand the circuit with long term goal of converting to a less unstable VCO
- Sounds *brilliant* when you put Yamaha CS-5 through it


## LM358 synth

- VCO part of the circuit works well, but the evelope doesn't
- Need to determine whether its the LDRs I'm using that are causing the problem
- Two options: ditch the envelope and just use the VCO, or fix the fault


## Drum machine



## Carnage VCO

- Need to sort the BOM and get it built!

## APC

- Fix the LED, 
- tidy up the battery/power housing issues 
- Sell it! ~Â£30?
