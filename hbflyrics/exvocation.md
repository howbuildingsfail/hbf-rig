This is my ex vocation
no need to explain
or to try to justify 
this decision

I am no longer commited
to do any of this
don't call it
artistic freedom

embrace the inactivity
unfinished projects
all behind me

play ps4 if i like
no one will remember me

20 summers left
no need
to make a difference
dont feel like i
need to be a difference
i did not start this
to feel a difference

non existent gaps
in non existent markets
I'm not here to create 
or to find those things

this is my ex vocation
live performeromerance
as punctuation 
of failed audiobedsit experiments

this is my ex vocation
turn up at 10
leave at 4 fuck it 
no need to explain

post-infotech revolutuionists
I sneer and I snipe
and I don't bother coalescing my bile
I *refuse* to condense it
into any sort of message

make a mess with the delay pedal
fuck up the drum machine
the guitar hurts my fingers
20 summers left

because this
is my ex
vocation







## original

This is my 
ex vocation 
no need to explain 
the public malaise 
post-industrial posts on social media 

20 summers left 
got no belief 

I sneer and I snipe 
can't quiesce the running commentary 
of criticism 

no longer seeking
a non existent gap
in a non existent
market

a ten mile trail of debris
 unfinished projects 
lies in my wake 
no need to explain 
no need to explain 
no need to do them all
or revisit them at all 

20 summers left

what money I have makes no interest
what interests I have make no money

the depression 
came back 

ex vocation 
20 summers left

Aah the uninitiated. Hurry back to your wonderful bubble of excitement, you almost weren't stimulated for a second there.
