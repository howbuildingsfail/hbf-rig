This is my  
ex vocation  
no need to explain  
the public malaise  
post-industrial posts on social media  

20 summers left  
got no belief  

I sneer and I snipe  
can't quiesce the running commentary  
of criticism  

a ten mile long vapour trail 
of unfinished projects   
lies in my wake  
no need to explain  
no need to explain  
no need to do them
or revisit at all  

20 summers left

what money I have makes no interest
what interests I have make no money

the depression  
came back  

ex vocation   
20 summers left

Aah the uninitiated. Hurry back to your wonderful bubble of excitement, you almost weren't stimulated for a second there.
