*chant:*  
*you have not done the things you have to do*


Before you feel pressure  
things about to drop  
it's not you ayou ayou  
don't know what you've got  

Before you feel pressure  
simplify your routine  
routines are mean for the keen has-beens  


Come in for a hard landing  
find a way out of this mess  
Before you feel pressure  
you have to know how to spend it  

Squandering  
time  
tending the vegetables  
75 times around the sun  

Before you feel Pressure
you've got to know when to stop
It is very hard to not measure 
the distance between what is, what was and what should have been
