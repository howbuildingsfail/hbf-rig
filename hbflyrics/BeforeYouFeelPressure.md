*chant:* 
*you have not done the things you have to do*


Before you feel pressure
things about to drop
it's not you ayou ayou
don't know what you've got

Before you feel pressure
simplify your routine
routines are mean for the keen has-beens


Come in for a hard landing
find a way out of this mess
Before you feel pressure
don't know how to spend it

Squandering
time

tending the vegetables
