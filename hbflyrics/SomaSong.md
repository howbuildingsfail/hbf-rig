This is a How Buildings Fail song

This one's for Soma Crew

cant afford to polish it
moving forward
health concerns
one last crack

occupy the space
between the bass 
and the face

metronomic; hypnotic; spazzmodic; episodic; titanic; the right sort of mettalic; 
burst the fabric 
inside of you and thirty feet away

the teenager I used to be; burning bright within me; blow the flame blow the flame
remove this crappy clutter; let the twats worry about the picture

can't cut it; don't cut it; go and see it. String A cancels string b
pull it out pull it out pull the effing focus out. better words polished turds. should have put the earplugs in

I hung on till the end and went home with ears screaming


we all have lovely teeth
but what exists underneath?





IS THIS THE ARE
