*based on themes in VU's rocknroll*

sun came up early and woke me way before I needed to be
I could hear the city movind and I knew it had nothing for me
no interest in eating or drink but I couldn't get back to sleep
then music came on and some calm washed through me and it showed a way to face the day

to face the day
to face the day
to face the day




that talk radio thing did nothing for me
