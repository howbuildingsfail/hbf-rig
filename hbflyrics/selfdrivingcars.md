I want security
I want a clean place to live
I wann to see diseases cured
and get treatment for free

Education 
is some sort of priority
and wealth redistribution 
is important to me

But I don't wanna go to mars in self driving cars

I want a hazy IPA
and a big lump of cheese
I can't do fruit in the morning
but that's just me

as I move into the twilight
I want a future for my kids
I'd like to travel a bit
and end poverty


But I don't wanna go to mars in self driving cars
I don't wanna go to mars in self driving cars
I don't wanna go to mars in self driving cars
I don't wanna go to mars in self driving cars
