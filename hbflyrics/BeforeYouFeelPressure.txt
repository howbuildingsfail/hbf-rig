Where there is harmony may we bring discord x 4

Before you feel pressure  
things about to drop  
it's not that you ayou ayou youyou  
don't know where you've got to

Before you feel pressure  
simplify your routine  
routines get mean for the keen has-beens  
if you see what I mean

Come in for a hard landing  
find a way out of this
Before you feel pressure  
you have to know how u- u- use it  

Before you feel Pressure
you've got to know how to stop
It is getting hard to not measure 
the distance between what is, what was and what should have been

*chant:*  
*you have not done the things you have to do*
