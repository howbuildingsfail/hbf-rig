Given the recent discussion where some cannot see the forest thru the trees, and where some actually condone intellectual laziness in a forum intended for newbies to the very experienced to learn and for each to improve their craft, the conversation dwindled to elitist bs claims, and those envious of some that have made their careers while being perpetual students of the engineering arts.

With that, I'm out, as I'll not participate in group that tolerates an entitlement mantra when it comes to passing along a craft, a vocation to those starting out. as many of us spent decades learning what bits of knowledge and specialty that we indulged in. To those insisting or condoning being spoon fed everything, good luck. Yes,that would be lazy by reasonable standards and not acceptable in the workplace, or at home.

I remain in the group for access to the mentoring program. until those I have currently onboard are done with their projects or have gained what they hope to accomplish with my role in it.
