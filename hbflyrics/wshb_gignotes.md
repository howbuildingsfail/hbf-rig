# WS16

- Intro from ash

then: 

- *It's practise* I sing itspractice and ash sings practiseitspractice
- *I have given up* - there's something in there but the words need tweaking - see "only disconnect". " I'm closing down so I can open up" 
- *I'm losing my edge* "MARK WYNN!" "something RRRReal!"
- *no filter* The organ bits are great
- *best work* - not the best musically! 
- *no filter* - I love it when the organ comes in after about 1 min. There's a confidence to this one
- *Hey* - Needs some handclapping!

# WS17

- intro from ash

then: 

_ *Do Not Construct* - although I like this - it's not a good fit for the rest of the set - the set is too short to support this
- *it's practise* 
- *no filter* I forgot a couple of the verses, which is a shame. I think this worked real well, 
- *before you feel pressure* v. patchy - praps too much chanting
- *best work* slower than gig 1. But better structurally. 
- *Hey*


# Observations

- large lyric sheets or know the words
- I want to go upbeat-er and dancier
