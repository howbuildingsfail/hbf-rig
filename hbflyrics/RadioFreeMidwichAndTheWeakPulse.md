# The Bee (Radio Free Midwich and the Weak Pulse)


I want to tell you about Radio Free Midwich and the Weak Pulse
Comes out of weavers cottages
intermittent and tuneless with zero precision
with no backbeat to speak of

Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
others, generous and confirmatory of the successes of capitalism
I love the friends that gather together at these times
We have construced podcasts in honour of our escaping
This is the land where Ned Ludd died

The dolmen in the forest, brightly painted
Is saying "forget the now
live with us on this mossy bank
out here on the perimiter the stars are coming back
out here we are stoic - slightly grubby"

Listen to this and I'll tell you bout the puritains
tell you bout the puritans and the loss of prayer
tell you bout the one great knight
wandering, the northern dream 
tell you bout the angel 




# "The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)"

I wanna tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master

Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others, mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died

The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying, "Forget the night.
Live with us in forests of azure.
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned â€“ immaculate."

Listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the heartache
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the loss of God
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with wrought iron soul

I'll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn

I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft-driven, slow and mad, like some new language

Now, listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the Texas
I'll tell you 'bout the Texas Radio
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
Wandering the Western dream
Tell you 'bout the maiden with wrought iron soul
