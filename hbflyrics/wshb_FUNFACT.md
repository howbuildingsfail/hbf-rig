My brain is just a god damn podcast that never ends
I think in sentences and though I know not everybody does, 
I find it impossible to imagine how non-verbal thought works.

 so some people don't have to suffer through the voice in their head 
going on a constant monologue? 
Is that what it means to achieve inner peace??
all of a sudden i forgot how to think

my thought processes work differently from most people; 
it's making me feel ill at ease.
 i often think in narration - i have a 'voice' i hear for it - 
but just as often, in feelings/abstractions/an 'understanding' 
that can't be put into words. help

And we talk among ourselves. 
And we think that we are doing well when we‚Äôre not.

And we should be out there amongst the public if we really want to understand what‚Äôs happening.

To be honest, if you start thinking that all of that is real [ie, Twitter], that‚Äôs where you get into real problems. And that has been a bit of a problem for the left in recent years. We spent a lot of time in this sort of hothouse of social media, particularly Twitter, when most of the country, if they are on social media, seem to be on Facebook.

Fun fact: some people have an internal narrative and some don't

As in, some people's thoughts are like sentences they "hear", and some people just have abstract non-verbal thoughts, and have to consciously verbalize them

And most people aren't aware of the other type of person
I've always thought this was so interesting. I think in sentences and though I know not everybody does, I find it impossible to imagine how non-verbal thought works.

Wait so some people don't have to suffer through the voice in their head going on a constant monologue?? Is that what it means to achieve inner peace??

The voice in my head is ADHD and on crack and it's ruining my life

all of a sudden i forgot how to think

So some people really have to say stuff out loud cause they can‚Äôt hear it in their head? Wow. It really bugged me to hear people talk their thoughts out cause I always thoight why won‚Äôt they just read it in their head. Well now I know and can‚Äôt judge

reading thread, feeling like my thought processes work differently from most people; it's making me feel ill at ease. i often think in narration - i have a 'voice' i hear for it - but just as often, in feelings/abstractions/an 'understanding' that can't be put into words. help

also yeah i 100% have to consciously work to convert my thoughts to verbal/sentences and it's actually like, noticeably exhausting/energy consuming. that or everything i say or do is completely impulsive and seemingly arbitrary

Yeah I can't even comprehend what the second one means.

This makes so much sense. I have ideas and thoughts all the time that immediately make perfect sense to me but I have trouble verbalizing them. I wonder if that's me

Hold on. I‚Äôm gonna need a scientist to weigh in on this. This shit real?! I feel like I think in sentences but my adhd gets in the way a lot...

I think I remembered a while ago asking people if their internal narrator had a gender and if it was the same as theirs and I learned that some people do not have one at all.

Can people hear songs. Like if I‚Äôm thinking of a song I can like play it in my head and I can hear it

The two types of people staring at each other like

me in my head trying to figure out which one I am: ‚Äúdo I have an internal narrative? I‚Äôm not quite sure, I wonder how you can determine whether or not that‚Äôs how you think. How incredibly difficult it- oh wait‚Äù

My thoughts are non-verbal, and I find it much easier to write than talk because it gives me more time to put my thoughts into words! I recently found out about this and it‚Äôs made me feel so much less alone.

SOME PEOPLE DONT HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR HEAD?????(

I used to be an ESL teacher, and I‚Äôve seen this play out a whole lotta ways. I remember one class was talking about which language they think in, and one guy yells out ‚Äúy‚Äôall think in words??!!‚Äù

This is so weird!!! Like y‚Äôall be hearing your thoughts??? Full on sentences in your head????
olliepop

So, for people who have internal monologues- do you dream in sentences?

suddenly i've forgotten how i think

does anyone‚Äôs brain generate images based on completely unrelated things?? like eg. when i was young, when id recite my times tables, the 2‚Äôs would be like snowy & 3‚Äôs would be the desert? and i rmbr doing algebra and certain functions would generate certain unique images?

this really fucked me up ü§Ø i‚Äôm the first one, and really thought everybody just constantly talked to themselves in their head, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always portrayed in movies/tv whenever someone has mind reading powers. this is so interesting

when i was in high school, i found out when some people read, they don't imagine things, they just see words. it's really interesting how differently we all absorb & process information

when i learned about this it significantly improved my life. as a rapid-fire conceptual thinker, i was frequently frustrated about the TIME it took others to problem solve. i was wrongly attributing it to intellect & really it's the disparity between concepts vs whole sentences.

i've got some sort of mental thing where i just am not able to visualise anything in my head. i wasn't even aware it was possible for years. i was yelled at because i couldn't add in my head - i couldn't visualise a chalkboard or the numbers. still can't do math in my head.

Basically you‚Äôre JD from Scrubs or you‚Äôre not

Yea, I literally relive every encounter I have word for word numerous times. Gotta love anxiety

Its hard to get the voice to shut up. When it starts talking it is hard to read anything because it needs to verbalize every word I read. If I get the voice to shut up I can read so much faster.

i think i'm the second one because i can't understand what the first one means

do you mean like they hear what they're going to say inside of their head before they say it out loud? or that like when they're silently thinking, they're thinking in full sentence thoughts constantly?
Fascinating... One wonders if those who don't verbalise internally have more or less problems with "negative self talk"

WHAT? I thought everyone heard what they wanted to say before saying it. Maybe that‚Äôs what determines speaking speeds. I think people that hear what they‚Äôre about to say can speak faster than people who can‚Äôt.

No mate, when I'm speaking i generally have no idea what I'm going to say until I'm saying it. As a result I speak really fast and go off on tangents.

Visual images often intrude on verbal thinking, study says
A new Harvard study shows that people create visual images to accompany their inner speech even when they are prompted to use verbal thinking, suggesting that visual thinking is deeply ingrained in...

oh yeah ? how do you know then smart guy

Hmm.  Do you have a source or a study on this?  Is kind of interesting...  would think the non-verbal abstract thinkers probably developed language, which then allowed the 'speaky thinkers' to develop?

I doubt that, more likely, there are idiots for whom the word, is the thing, and those who merely use words to express the thing.

I have always had verbal thoughts. But when I was in a very mentally toxic relationship, I never had internal narrative. It's like I was so completely secluded from the world that I was even secluded from myself. I could never think straight and it's as if I lost myself.
Alex Benjamin

After breaking up and healing from the whole situation, I slowly gained this internal monologue back. I honestly feel so much better inside. Like I finally have myself back, and can finally think how I always did, with no restrictions

love this topic/ conversation. i hear a voice when i‚Äôm reading & i hear my internal narrative in full sentences. the only time i do not is when meditating & purposefully trying not to

I'm aware of the other because a highschool teacher said, "Without language, we couldn't think!" I laughed, "What! Who thinks in words?"

My friends: "uhhh... Everyone?"

I‚Äôve also noticed I have two layers of thoughts, the more up-front conscious thought and the quieter, deeper level of thought. I noticed this during meditation, I can quiet the first layer but not the second

my thoughts and reading are non-verbal! my default reading speed is very very fast!

my mind is BLOWN by this revelation!! i'm the second type of person and my thoughts are always just concepts reinforced by images and/or emotions; thinking is completely separate from talking to myself in my head and i have to make a conscious effort to do so

every time i watch "what women want" i'm like here we go again, i have to suspend my disbelief over the fact that mel gibson is hearing all of these women's never-ending internal monologues in his head, even though that's not how actual thinking works, zzz

And some people can't visualize things in their minds. It's called aphantasia.

When I am thinking I think in words. Like if someone says "think of an elephant" my brains reaction is to picture the word elephant. I can conjure up an image of what an elephant looks like, but it's not my brains first inclination.

I found that out talking w/friend about reading books. I always visualize what the author is writing like a movie and as a child sometimes I had to remind myself it wasnt a movie I watched it was a book I read.

I remember when a teacher tried to teach me to read faster, he said to stop listening to the "voice" in my read that was reading the words "out loud", and instead just absorb the information that the words represent without attaching a sound to it.

It was the most //

// batshit-crazy-sounding advice anyone had ever given me. How can I possibly conceive of "the dog ran down the street" without thinking the sentence "the dog ran down the street"?

Used to do cognitive behavioral therapy, and there was no discussion of this in grad school. I wonder if the cognitive portion of that treatment (involving changing self talk and disputing thinking errors) is less helpful or works differently for people with non-verbal thoughtsü§î

Also, some people imagine things as images they "see" in their head, others don't, and assume all talk about visualisation is metaphorical

A sociology prof once told my class, ‚ÄúNo one thinks in sentences!‚Äù and chuckled at the wacky idea. I was completely stunned because I always had. I then started asking everyone I knew. Regardless of their answer, they were all shocked that anyone would answer the opposite.


My thought process is like a never-ending conversation, sometimes it's me talking to myself or to someone else. Then I keep repeating sentences for no reason.
It's tiring but I guess it keeps me occupied. 

I also have aphantasia, it's hard to tell people I can't imagine.



Found this out when we were studying ‚Äúferal children‚Äù at school and someone asked ‚ÄúIf they never learn language, how do they think ?‚Äù 


OKAY so question for non-verbal thinkers: does your brain ever just randomly play music or get songs stuck in your head? Because as a verbal thinker my brain never shuts up and there‚Äôs almost ALWAYS annoying background music

Questions for people who ‚Äúhear‚Äù their thoughts: what if you need to think faster than your internal monologue can talk? Can you have multiple monologues at the same time? Also, what was being a baby like? Did learning language change your experience of thinking?

Ah shit, I have them all

I've even started talking out loud, I don't know what exactly caused it



Richard Feynman described an informal experiment from his college days comparing people who "see" numbers and people who "hear" numbers. The "hearing" people were not disturbed by visual distractions, and the "seeing" people were not disturbed by distracting sounds.



i'm the second one,, it's kinda all just THERE and it's fragments of words and pictures and you're aware of you thoughts but it's not an actual sentence


That is a fun fact! I had no idea.
I have this propensity to have incredibly long self-justification dialogues with people in my head. I only learned recently that it's a bit weird and unhelpful and can cause me to spiral into depression.

Other fun fact: Therapy is good.
