I was riding past the running track
and I was thinking about time and days
we are burning through the days
they are burning in front of our eyes
they light up our experience and are gone
and our lives are a tiny bit higher on that pile of ash
wasted days, brilliant days, grief days, 
each the same grey thickness
that we stand upon when we wake
and remember
