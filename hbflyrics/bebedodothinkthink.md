*I've had a lot of goes at this- strucure emerging slowly - vague transition from 'be' to 'do' via 'think', but there's a feeling of loss of interest in the world throughout*


be be be be be
be be be be be
be be be be be
be be be be be

here i am i am 
standing in front of you
you might look at me
but i be just be

be be be be be
be be be be be
be do be be do
do be be do do

Don't ask me what I do
I do nothing
Don't tell me what you do 
I'm not interested

be do do be do
do do do do do
do do think think do
do think think do do 

before do i think
thinking what to do
do can not pre think
do can not just do

do think think do do
think do think think do
think to think think think
think think think think think


think think think think think
think think think think think
think think think think think
think think think think think


think! think! think! think! think!
think! think! think! think! think!
think!! think!! think!! think!! think!!
think!! think!! think!! think!! think!!
