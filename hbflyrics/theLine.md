I was a kid. About 13. 
I had homework. Biology
Wasn't interested - bad teacher?
so I finished perfuncotrally across 2 pages. 

Then I drew a line around the writing
then I drew a line around the line
suddenly it hit me - I could draw lines around the lines. Just keep on. No thinking

This was friday night about 8pm. 
Carried on till 10
each line - by geometry - was taking longer to do
