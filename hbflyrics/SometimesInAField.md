Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I sit down and look up laughing at the sun
                       gently / shyly

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I take a look at the flowers, wonder where they came from
  pay attention to the grasses

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
i pick up my breath and blow the wind right through the trees

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I wonder how I got here, and whether to go back
(now)

Sometimes in a field
Sometimes in a field
Sometimes in a field
Sometimes in a field 

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I can get just enough water and enough sleep

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I see an animal in the distance just staring at me
        red deer 

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I can kick around the brown soil for to find a good rock
                                                    stone

Sometimes in a field, for no reason
I forget how I got here, and I forget if I should go back
(now)


Sometimes in my kitchen I get bad feeings
Don't put "the Idiot" on
Don't put "the Idiot" on
