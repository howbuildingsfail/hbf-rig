Here it is - open it
that thing you purchased
in kit form
for self assembly at home

do not collect
do not publish
do not make
do not construct 

its cheaper that way

to put it together for you?

do not collect
do not publish
do not make
do not construct 

when in doubt 
read the instructions
in these dark times
here is a lesson

do not collect
do not publish
do not make
do not construct 

you cannot document it
you cannot document it
you cannot document it
you cannot document it

don't try to collect it
don't try to collect it
don't try to collect it
don't try to collect it

they are just artefacts
they are just artefacts
they are just artefacts
they are just artefacts

of others 
trying
to do 
art

fail to collect
a failure to publish
fail to make
fail to construct
