I was minding my own business  
when something seemed to change  
I made a leap  
So I could see underneath  

now it would not be right  
to take advantage of this facility  
it would not be moral  
to exploit this new ability  

I was minding my own business  
when everything seemed to change  
I made a leap  
now I can see underneath  

those loops that they wrote down  
I can walk throgh holes in them  
and the unwritten constitution - ha  
I make them wish they'd picked up their ink pens  

I was minding my own business  
when the world seemed to move a bit sidewards  
I carpe diemed the situation  
so I could get at what's underneath  

pink light  
exegesis  
pink light   
exegesis  
pink light  
exegesis  
pink light  
1 million words to write  
but not tonight  

I was minding my own business  
when something seemed to change  
I made a leap  
So I could see underneath  

I had a conversation with the planets  
I slid out of my dimension  
I made connections  
I saw the links

Open the brain  
direct access  
the knowlege was transferred   
without language  
no specific memories  
just principles fixed directly within the neurons
