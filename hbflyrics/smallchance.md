you've got a very small chance
of doing what you want
even if you know what it is
the chances are slim

but we can dance
and say nice things to each other
and ignore the newspapers
what do thay know

you've got a very small chance
of knowing what you're here for
but that's alright
noone gives permission

rich people aren't happy 
so do not be jealous of them
their success with money
has cost them their centre

we have a very small chance
of being what we want to be
you didn't please your mummy
but she was misguided anyway
