Its not you culture
its me


I am in the habit of concealing myself
I am in the habit of contradicting myself
by the upstairs back door

Something happened to me as a young man
something probably happened to me as a young man

there is no nash equilibrim in this situation
there is only so much attention that I can give
I can not dance to your dance music 
and I hate what you did to the human league and heaven 17

I do not get the happy happy songs
the milkman whistles teenage kicks

I see beauty in ditches and pylons; the manhole cover forms a face
I burn the toast and I eat it anyway
