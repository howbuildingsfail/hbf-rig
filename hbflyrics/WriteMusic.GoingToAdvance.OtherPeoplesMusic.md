*either WHB or tightrope - quite fast and gang of four-y*

We are going to advance
We are going to advance
We are going to advance

We are going to dance
We are going to dance
We are going to dance
We are going to dance

*repeat*


# Other peoples music

"Its Radio 2 for people who used to like music, 
store their old vinyl in the attic and 
take their children to music festivals.."

I used to like music
put my vinyl in the attic
I bought tickets for the festival
but I never left my tent

I used to like music
it used to shake me sideways/alive
I used my ammo up on Lammo
used to listen to the radio - listen to the radio



I used to like music
