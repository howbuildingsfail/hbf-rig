quick as you like
quick as you like
get this down as quick as you like

Not too quick obviously
or the clock wont tick properly

there is grace in this state of creativity
I'm not writing this for you 
I'm doing this for me

quick as you like
quick as you like
empty your head of the silver fish

Not too quick obviously
Or the bubble will burst over me

there is grace in this state of creativity
I'm not making this for you 
I'm singing it for me

gone
gone....

GONE!
