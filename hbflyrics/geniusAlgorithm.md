*something like this*

The genius algorithm
treats me as a state
I will not be controlled
I will not be predicted

the genius algorithm
puts me in with lefties
there is much more to me
than could ever be expected

the genius algorithm
is taking down the country
I will not covet my neighbour
I will not buy that machine

the english scheme


I'm doing things 
that I will not wish I had done
