Tall bikes as if it were an EMOM (gives me a way in)


Glad you like it, thanks
how much how much
not for sale not for sale
I can show you how to make it

captain beefheart where i got it you didnt have to pay for it



we had to start somewhere

better than last year


Deep in the woods
A tig welder sputters
sputters
sputters





This stuff wasn't there
we built the skills 
we make the language

there a people here
who care

off the shelf - no satisfaction
online help - no satisfaction
A & R - no satisfaction
there's no short cut to satisfaction
no short cut to satisfaction

it wasn't easy it wasn't cheap
it took time and persistence

and made

tall bikes small steps tall bikes
better than last year

unsullied by commercial sensibilities

we make the bikes we want to ride
we ride the bikes to figure out what to make
the joy of building
it's not a product
it's a process


This stuff wasn't there
This stuff wasn't there
This stuff wasn't there
before we were
