The clue is in the name he said  
you are a human being  
but you are acting like a human doing  
you need to stop being the human doing  
and start doing a human being  

That's all very well I said  
but what about the things I'm not doing  
to start being a human being  
I'd need to stop doing the things I'm doing  

I haven't the time to be a human being  
I'm too busy being a human doing  
when I get the chance to do something  
shoud I start doing a human being  

I know how to get doing done  
but noone told me how to get going into being  

In the beginning I was a human being  
but I had to stop being so I could do the things I needed to be doing  
now you're telling me I need to do something else?  

nonono he said  
what you're being is a being doing  
how did being a being doing come to be?  
but I didn't do it  
I didn't do it  
I didn't
