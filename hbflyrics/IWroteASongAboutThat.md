The summers got warmer and wetter 
so I wrote a song about that
there's no gun laws in america
so I wrote a song about that
the tories were in power for ten years
so I wrote a song about that
the billionaires were screwing the workers
while I wrote a song about that

I wrote a song about that
I wrote a song about that

I had to wait six months for treatment
so I wrote a song about that
I couldn't get the job I trained for
so I wrote a song about that
I have genuine fears for my chidlren
so I wrote a song about that
the medicine was costing a fortune
so I wrote a song about that

I wrote a song about that
I wrote a song about that

the insects didn't visit the flowers
so I wrote a song about that
I sat staring at the wall for hours
so I wrote a song about that
I lost interest in food and sex 
so I wrote a song about that
and I felt myself race to the end
so I wrote a song about that

I wrote a song about that
I wrote a song about that

Might as well make some shitty art out of the end of the world, right?
