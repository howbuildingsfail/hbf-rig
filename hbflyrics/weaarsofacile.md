We are so facile  
objects over experience  
We are so facile  
ersatz conveniences  

We are so facile  
there is nothing left  
to achieve  
We are so facile  
cancel belief  
because it's ok google  

w.a.s.f.
beleive the adverts
w.a.s.f.



we were never so young
we were frightened
we were stupid
we were


we are so facile
if you can't see my mirrors 
then I can't see you

wasf
property before people
wasf
sofas over socialising
wasf
convenience food is
lead in my belly




# We are so fragile - 

We are so fragile\
Advertising lies\
That are whiter than yours\
We are so fragile\
They could give us a war\
Just to keep us amused 

We are so fragile
I could stay here inside
And say 'It's all been done'
We are so fragile
Just pretend I never tried
I'll leave up to you 

We are still so young
And it must be wrong
But I'll do it all the same
We are really so shy
There's nothing I can do
Except believe in you 

We could always go home
But everyone says
This is the place to be
We are so unnatural
But you wouldn't understand
You only deal with men
