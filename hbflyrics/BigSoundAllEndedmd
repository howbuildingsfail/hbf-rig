Big sounds are easy
but they dont connect me
never take me
make me think
about the speed
neglecting the need
for tenderness 
compassion and hurt
here in my soul
at the end of the night

Big sounds are easy 
but people don't then get me
theres exposure in the tension
in the space
between the bursting
