Deviation from the norm  
I wanted to inform you
progress is possible
by deviation from the norm

without progress we stagnate
blame the state
decades too late
investment obligation
in time resources and attention
I'm in a state to deviate

to think the sun is not a sphere
to never hold your presence dear
empty glasses six times over
erase the days! erase the days!

we perform the standards sideways
within a maze of contradictions
minus friction
moss on ruins
crappy trousers
drum machine guns

deviation from the norm
is not by choice or cash coercion
only progress only can be
by deviation from the norm
