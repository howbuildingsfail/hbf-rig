#NO FILTER

*based on the idea that C. Nosnibor is reading restaurant reviews at his spoken word nights*


No filter
insolence over senesence
The vegetables were previously underdone
when you write things down 
they lose their power

No filter
The Love Songs weren't helping
the living embodiment of entertainment
Perfectly poised to pontificate pointlessly

No Filter
he's only happy
he's only happy
when he's ranting

No filter
frankly hilarious corkage
