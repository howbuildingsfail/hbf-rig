The Captain felt like a glass shrimp

You should never let the media in

I've forgotten what I came here for
"do you want an answer to that?"
"not really"



I walked to the shops with my headphones on
I went round the shops
Came back from the shops
went round the copice


we are waiting for the crops to grow


The Captain feels like a glass shrimp


Emptiness in time

The atoms moved unexpectedly
and the enemy arrives by limousine


Emptiness in time
comes back to bite you
It is the modern world
it is the way
we live today


Emptiness in time
enjoy the solitude
keep the worries and needs
at arms length
for now


Emptiness in time
my fingers don't do 
what they used to do
it's the qwerty threat 
and it's an endurance event


Emptiness in time
keep fighting wrong battles
keep trudging in circles
where do we go from here
the enemy arrives by limousine


Emptiness in time
sit back with a bottle 
hold the screen at arms length
screw up your eyes 
without glasses
read the same blurred thing again
it'll be ok 
tomorrow

Emptiness in time
biting hard on the big sound
I can't
