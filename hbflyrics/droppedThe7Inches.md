I tried to move some shelves 
and things I once held precious fell
not broken just more crumpled sleeves
that took a bit from some fake market price

but then my task forgotten I sat and looked 
through artefacts of accidental youth
of sound acquired deliberate or fate
that I once danced to on my own or with a mate

the act of listening has been for me
a half religous thing throughout my life
to willingly suspend self criticism
for a moment or an hour after wine
