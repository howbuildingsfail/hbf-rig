It's not you, culture
it's me
It's not you, culture
it's me


Your dance music stops me dancing
your stupid-happy songs make me unhappy
military marches make me want a bit of peace
meanwhile the ignorant are laughing
in the sun

It's not you, culture
it's me
It's not you, culture
it's me

you just want to meonetize the mediocre
I want to see things that make me think
you are probably right: 
something happened to me when I was younger
but I don't like  what you did 
to the human league 
and heaven 17 

It's not you, culture
it's me
It's not you, culture
it's me

I had a jar of coffee and I took some of these
happy happy joy joy from my head to my knees
and I think about leaving the house
It's in the air for you and me


It's not you, culture
it's me
It's not you, culture
it's me
