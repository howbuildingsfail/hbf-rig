The world is very different now
We look across the room 
and we wonder how

Having lost sight of a lot of years
gives you no wisdom
raises new fears
yeilds tears

wear and tear 
go to bed scared
witness the dawns
and the sunsets

the world is very different now
foxes in cites
dragonflies in yorkshire
the new north passage
water on the moon 

giant steps
help that boy boogie woogie
help that boy
because it's in him
because it's in 
him

loneliness in the workplace
apes debased
ther is no place
for these feelings today


default to in-person communication
encourage mentorship
bake in social time
build effective social spaces


check the depth of the sandpit
the pool table
is not level

only 7 balls
the alcoholic buys cans at the bar
free hotel in winchester

the world is very different now
