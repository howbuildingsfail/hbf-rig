I'm beginning to wonder 
if i've had 
total control too long

whether to hand back power
to the idiots i took it from

i set up on my own
half a lifetime ago

i couldn't find a kindred spirit
couldn't connect another soul

tried to find a way to make it anyway
but when i succeeded it became too easy




I'm beginning to wonder if i've had total control too long

I  set the duration 
of this piece of art I give to you
I set out the delivery
I choose the beat and the tune

but

I'm beginning to wonder 
if i've had 
total control too long

whether to hand back power
to the idiots i took it from

their clockwork genius bores me
effortlessness increases the effort
i doubt myself and crave attention
if i know i can do it
i don't need to bother



I'm beginning to wonder 
if i've had 
total control too long


half assed brass trombones
have more power than Trevor Horn
the clown



if its a sufficient condition
for ending this practice



I decide where the rain falls
i decide the phase of the moon


I have got to the place 
I wanted to get to 
I can see it all 
from here
