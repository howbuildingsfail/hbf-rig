I bought two of these for about $.50 when lilleffects was closing down his PCB operation. Unfortunately any info
regarding them has been taken down. Luckily the PCB has all the components marked:


# BOM

1uf cap	
100n cap
4148 diode
MPSA13 transistor
10k resistor
?? Pot (Art Garceau says 100k log will do it)
