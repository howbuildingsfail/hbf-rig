# midi files:

- *but I don't* is not midi!
- *puffcornish* is a bit power of lard meets daf
- *dp2* is an sr2020 beat converted to midi
- *worst pub in warrington* is sort of glitchy 'blindness' - not quite there yer
- *dp1* is the other sr2020 beat


# TODO:

- **DONE** find good netron bass sound
- **Practice!** work out transition from space to bass
- **DONE** work out 'worst pub' from neutron jam -> midi
- rehearse whole set, making notes on changes/settings
- edit `start.sh` to set up properly: neturon, nanokeys, roadrunner:

## but i don't

I practice
but I don't learn
I practice
but I don't learn

practicing imrovising
feels like cheating
doing it again is harder
loses the feeling
do it again but better
do it again but better

no rhyming couplets here
no iambic pentameter here
no first episodic digression here
no retro-refrain here

god only knows
god only knows

symphony in my pocket
next to my snotty rag
no received dominant charge now maintained here


I practice
but I don't learn
I practice
but I don't learn 

not there yet
I do phrasing
I've come to know what repeats good
without progress
we are inamess
I watched the news while I ate my tea
what new hell is this
springtime outside
springtime outside

I practice
but I don't learn


# Puff cornish

puff cornish
if you know you know
30 percent meat
21 percent meat
15 percent meat
3 percent meat

puff cornish
if you know you know
dispose of the wrapper (carefully)
3% meat

puff cornish 
1950 percent of your recommended daily intake
in through the out door
mechanically recovered vegetables
3% meat


1,500th premises, a store in york on 5th March 2011
its a red salt traffic light
its a red salt traffic light

puff cornish
lighthearted social media response

puff cornish
freshly frozen 
in Balliol business park
Longbenton
came here via Bramley

puff cornish
working closely with local health protection team 

if you know you know you know you know




# worst pub in warrington

we took a break
from tuff gong
to go for a drink 
in original wire boozer

pretty much 
the worst pub in warrrington
pretty much
the worst pub in warrington
---

I remember
a cloud of flies
I remember
a cloud of non-biting insects
buzzing around
in there

And in the car
on the way back 
we heard witness
by Roots Manuva
And spencer got excited
and spencer got excited

We were inspired
by the groove
and I think spencer started the beat
and then steve came up with the bass

---

The mark went in
to do his vocal sessions
to lean in on his vocal sessions
and he made it
a fall song

day one: 
band recording
worst pub in warrington
day two: vocals
worst pub in warrington
tay three: mixing
worst pub in warrington

or something close to that

I don't even know 
how it is credited
I had lost the will 
to do battle over credits
I had lost the will


# you worry too much
