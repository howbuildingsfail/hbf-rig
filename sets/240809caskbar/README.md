# General points

Really pleased with how this went down! Friendly audience because Hulot is a good match to HBF (and how could they not be), so right-minded people were in attendance

# General Technical Issues

- Nowhere to put my kit! just a tiny table and a stool - made it tricky to set up
- It's a *bad idea* to just bung stuff in a rucksack - it's hard to know where all the stuff is and adds to anxiety. I think I should organise this better either by investing in a case or a smaller rig generally - need to think this through
- I *think* the guitar was ok, but there seemed to be a bit of intermittentness coming through the monitor - need to clean the switches etc. Hard to recreate the fault!
- The bass seemed to go a bit muddy and I'm not sure why - need to be able to fix this on-the-fly - or use a different bass synth! 
- we ran out of plug sockets: need another 4-bar for 2 laptops and the Tascam recorder..! 

# song-by-song

- **tortoise:** this went down *really* well - was super surprised by the cheer I got at the end of this - no structure, hardly any guitar, hardly any volca, just a bangin' beat and bass and some good lyrics...
- **(b4 pressure)** *I was right to abandon this!*
- **C. supply** was pleased with the guitar on this and got the timing right for the lyrics until near the end (didn't get to do the 'demand' thing...)
- **To get music** I was growing in confidence now cos people seemed to get it. The landlady was watching from the bar with a smile...and lots of people liked the lyrics! 1st use of grainy drums at end
- **Crap band** got a cheer - but not as big as tortoise -- maybe the guitar was loud?? couldn't hear the bass very well either
- **job** I think i was having some guitar problems here, but the feedbacker bit worked at least once. This song is too depressing though! 
- **culture** went on a bit, but doing the volca lfo speed at the end saved the day, and then mucking about with the drum grains
- **chelsea tractors** just loved doing it - good cheers. It's so fast I need to shorten some of the lines though! drum grains again was perhaps too many times - I need more effects! Or to drop this thing in the middle! 





..*wish I'd recorded it!*



==================
# LYRICS AND NOTES
==================

# 01: I am the tortoise
 
*Guitar. 2 semitones up (or down) to barre E at A on bottom E string- but only play top 2-3 strings to follow up. Don't do this while singing!* 
 
**ACTIONS:** 1. see if there's a volca riff anywhere; 2.  
 
I am the tortoise x4

I am the tortoise            	and you won't find me  
don't have an agent      	I'm ex-directory - 
I am the torotoise		and I have memories
not been around much            because  I met the deity  
Not in the circle            	Not at the gates  
Not in some soft lit room    	taking the piss out of my mates  

I am the tortoise		and i can teach yu 
1 thing or 2			like I did Riley
like I did Scanlon		like I did Bramah
like I did Hanley

galapagos: gala pa gus

I am the tortise 		itb's  my decision
i chose these claws		and this strange location 
there is no culture here	no scene here 
nothing to sneer at here	no cloudy-beer village hall chairs tables made of pallets here

not like that easter island tourist metropolis
put yuor oxfam joydivision long coat on now
put your mcmillan argyle tank top on now
put your hard hat carapace on now

I am the tortoise 		you are the youth
I make better decisions now	better than you do anyway
better than you do anyway	better than you do anyway
better than you do anyway	better than you do anyway


*spares*
I am the tortoise  	        I did not ascend  
not sat with Jimi		not sat with Kurt
not sat with Jonesy		not sat with burt-a-baracharach
not sat with John the ex foxx 
cos hes not not dead yet


# 02 Before you feel presure

**ACtions** the guitar works, but the structure needs to fit. Happy to be short. practise starting with guitar but hitting spacebar somehow. Also play with whammy bar/feedbacker combination; 2: put in volca riff at 33:52 from 04/08 asr recording - 34:50


Before you feel pressure 		things about to let it drop  
it's not that you ayou ayou youyou  	don't know where you've got to
see what I mean

<chorus>
Come in for a hard landing		find a way out of this
Before you feel pressure  		you have to know how u- u- use it  

Before you feel pressure 		simplify your routine  
routines get mean for 			the keen has-been  
if you 

ask yourself this question		do you really want to live like this?

Before you feel Pressure		you've got to know how to stop
It is getting hard to not measure 	the distance between what is, 
what was and what should have been




# 03: Creative supply

*Guitar    a12 d11 to a10 d12 (I think)*
d7 &b10 for gah-like bit: easier to sing!

**ACTIoNs:** *done* 1: echo on volca riff - and check out the ENV sweep, it seems to have disappeared! 



# 04: To Get Music

**SETUP:** Tempo to middl, lfo to saw


*Guitar Chords: E and A, a bit like waiting for the man*

**ACTIONS:** 1. tidy up the rageddy end to follow the words better; 2. See if key-trigger gives better tracking between volca LFO and beat; 3: decision; no barre chords - except for 'jazz hits' like drums used to do... 

You are not in a nightclub		you might be walking down the street
maybe even doing the washing up		until the rhythm hits your feet
Aerosmith in the dentist		Adele in Morrisons
The girl from ipanema in the elevator	but you're still not moving your bum - you've got to 
dance to get music
dance to get music


If your my age you'd like the cold wave		but for other generations it's dull
Mick Ronson that bloke with the sideburns 	and throbbing gristle came from Hull

Edison's wax cylinder			or the rega planar 3
diffrent quality reproduction 		but the same technology
drag a diamond down a valley		connect it to a diaphragm
uptown records on market street		selectadisc in nottingham will help you to
dance to get music
dance to get music

                                    bunch of old
(you might be) out on a date with a couple of mates or bim b ling around at home
dancing queen and come on eileen are never off the gramophone 


dance to get music
dance to get music

# 05: Crap band

**ACTION** Sort out the drum bips! should be hh!

# 06 I am your job

**Actions** try with sparser guitar; Sing in low register 




# 07: It's not you culture

**ACTIONS:** *done* 1: Program Volca controls in - either then play them manually, program them in, or a mix of both

1st verse: single oscilating note, no porta until contradicting - then mucking about

it's not you culture - it's me
it's not you culture - it's me
i am in the habit of concealing myself
i am in the habit of contradicting myself
it's not you culture - it's me
it's not you culture - it's me
something probably happened to me as a young man
do not recommend your bandcamp I will not listen

it's not you culture - it's me
it's not you culture - it's me
there is no nash equilibrium in this situation
there is only so much attention i can give
I can not dance to your dance music
and I hate what you did to the human league and heaven17
it's not you culture - it's me
it's not you culture - it's me


I do not get the happy happy songs
the milkman whistles teenage kicks
- I see beauty in ditches and pylons
the manhole cover makes a face
I burn the toast and I eat it anyway
it's not you culture - it's me
it's not you culture - it's me


# 08 Chelsea Tractors

**actions:** 3x snare roll at end; one note solo!

they cost 8 5 thousand pounds		Sweat with the aircon down
they are blue passport bastards		clowns drive around town in  the 

chelsea tractors and their drivers 

sushi digestion				poor staff retention
restrict your wages			rolled up pressed shirt sleeves
roll fold up shirt sleeves the


had a 4X for 2 days			stuck in the carport for 2 days
turbo generator malaise			I saw the class war in mettalic grey
palaces of edwardian glass		brutalism for the working class
I know which I'd rather have
I know I do not have a

chelsea tractor
not a driver
chelsea tractor
I'm not a driver of the
