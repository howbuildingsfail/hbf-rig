### 01 To Get Music

- 000220 and 003220 are 'a' and 'c' rif basics - move up to 12th fret
- there's a version where I slide up and down 12 frets with clean sound - I like that
- move the high-pitched stuff to the neutron voice
- see if you can write the MIDI for the drum pitch change

**v2**
Fix the drums!
Guitar chord stab at "edison's" line works - more of these & fewer blocks of sounds - except near the end..?


### 02 I am the tortoise!

Quite like how 'High 5' guitar solo fits in with this! but with a mix of Hippo Poachers' Amerika
- also octaver in sung bits works
- need more variety in the drums

**v2**

Have confidence for zero guitar while singing
Apart from that- real good! 

### 03 Creative Supply
figure out what the chords were here - particularly last (truncated) verse

- after 1 drum cyble
creative supply is outstripping demand		too many artists bloggers bands
can't get to the bar

- after 1 drum cycle 
they come here cose
got time and facilities to create
creative supply is outstripping demand 		too many artists bloggers bands
ca
herds


- plinky comes in - after 1 cycle





### 04 Not you culture 

Perhaps sped up too much? 
Need to figure out drums 
Nice guitar line! - fuzz ON for this one...! (perhaps the very last bit would be good dry though)
Would be great if we could add the volca bit of old - that would be a complete track
drums are nearly there! 

### 05 Iam your job

Not bad! 

- Need perhaps something for the volca to do?
- Also check tuning? 
- drumz DONE

### 06 Before you feel pressure

*drone on 3 A notes throughout, using feedbacker*

### 07 Chelsea tractors


### 08 Crap Band

*I Know the chords: A C G verse, then descending 6 and ascending 4 semitones in chorous bit starting at f*
