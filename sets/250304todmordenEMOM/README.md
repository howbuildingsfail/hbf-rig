# LYRICS AND NOTES
==================

# 01: I am the tortoise
 
*Guitar. 2 semitones up (or down) to barre E at A on bottom E string- but only play top 2-3 strings to follow up. Don't do this while singing!* 
 
**ACTIONS:** 1. see if there's a volca riff anywhere; 2.  
 
I am the tortoise x4

I am the tortoise            	and you won't find me  
don't have an agent      	I'm ex-directory - 
I am the torotoise		and I have memories
not been around much            because  I met the deity  
Not in the circle            	Not at the gates  
Not in some soft lit room    	taking the piss out of my mates  

I am the tortoise		and i can teach yu 
1 thing or 2			like I did Riley
like I did Scanlon		like I did Bramah
like I did Hanley

galapagos: gala pa gus

I am the tortise 		itb's  my decision
i chose these claws		and this strange location 
there is no culture here	no scene here 
nothing to sneer at here	no cloudy-beer village hall chairs tables made of pallets here

not like that easter island tourist metropolis
put yuor oxfam joydivision long coat on now
put your mcmillan argyle tank top on now
put your hard hat carapace on now

I am the tortoise 		you are the youth
I make better decisions now	better than you do anyway
better than you do anyway	better than you do anyway
better than you do anyway	better than you do anyway


*spares*
I am the tortoise  	        I did not ascend  
not sat with Jimi		not sat with Kurt
not sat with Jonesy		not sat with burt-a-baracharach
not sat with John the ex foxx 
cos hes not not dead yet


# 03: Creative supply

*Guitar    a12 d11 to a10 d12 (I think)*
d7 &b10 for gah-like bit: easier to sing!

**ACTIoNs:** *done* 1: echo on volca riff - and check out the ENV sweep, it seems to have disappeared! 

# Good Group

So you wanna be a good group
Well here's what you must do
The world is changing quickly
You should not try to keep up


So you wanna be a good group
Well here's what you must do
Lose the master tapes at a party
Break up after 1 album
never do a side project
release a short run single on an obscure belgian label


So you wanna be a good group
Well here's what you must do
experiment with two drummers
sack the drummer sack the drummer

rehearse in a secluded shack
record an album in 40 minutes



# 04: To Get Music

**SETUP:** Tempo to middl, lfo to saw


*Guitar Chords: E and A, a bit like waiting for the man*

**ACTIONS:** 1. tidy up the rageddy end to follow the words better; 2. See if key-trigger gives better tracking between volca LFO and beat; 3: decision; no barre chords - except for 'jazz hits' like drums used to do... 

You are not in a nightclub		you might be walking down the street
maybe even doing the washing up		until the rhythm hits your feet
Aerosmith in the dentist		Adele in Morrisons
The girl from ipanema in the elevator	but you're still not moving your bum - you've got to 
dance to get music
dance to get music


If your my age you'd like the cold wave		but for other generations it's dull
Mick Ronson that bloke with the sideburns 	and throbbing gristle came from Hull

Edison's wax cylinder			or the rega planar 3
diffrent quality reproduction 		but the same technology
drag a diamond down a valley		connect it to a diaphragm
uptown records on market street		selectadisc in nottingham will help you to
dance to get music
dance to get music

                                    bunch of old
(you might be) out on a date with a couple of mates or bim b ling around at home
dancing queen and come on eileen are never off the gramophone 


dance to get music
dance to get music


# 08 Chelsea Tractors

**actions:** 3x snare roll at end; one note solo!

they cost 8 5 thousand pounds		Sweat with the aircon down
they are blue passport bastards		clowns drive around town in  the 

chelsea tractors and their drivers 

sushi digestion				poor staff retention
restrict your wages			rolled up pressed shirt sleeves
roll fold up shirt sleeves the


had a 4-4 for 2 days			stuck in a carport for 2 days
turbo generator malaise			saw class war in mettalic grey
palaces of edwardian glass		brutalism for the working class



--I know which I'd rather have
--I know I do not have a

chelsea tractor
not a driver
chelsea tractor
I'm not a driver of the

# 09 Good group

good group
good group

so 
   you wanna be a good group
so you wannt be a good group
so you wannt be a good group
so you wannt be a good group

well here's what you must do
well here's what you must do
well here's what you must do
well here's what you must do

the world is changing quickly
the world is changing quickly
you should not try to keep up
you should not try to keep up


you sometimes have to suffer to start the creative engine
but that can have an impact on your quality of life

you might just have to suffer to spark the creative process
but note detrimental effect on quality of life
you might just have to suffer to spark the creative process
but note detrimental effect on quality of life



when throwing televisions from an upper floor hotel room
you should first remove the rolls royce from the children's swimming pool


resist the youthful urges to shine brightly and too quickly
or you'll end up like Mike Batt and be remembered for the wombles
